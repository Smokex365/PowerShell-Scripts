PowerShell-Scripts
==================
A assortment of various PowerShell Scripts either functional or a WiP


ProcessExplorerInstaller.ps1

Downloads and installs Sysinternals Process Explorer (defaults to Program Files). Largely replaced by chocolatey and winget but still useful for systems that can't install those tools.

RandomAlphanumericStringToClipboard.ps1

Generates a random alphanumeric string of the specified length and copies it to the clipboard.

hwinfo-restart.ps1

A simple looping script to restart hwinfo every 8 hours to bypass the free 12 hour limit for shared memory access. Cheap workaround for an application that really didn't warrant a full license.
